# **Fish Aquarium Project**

This project is a graphical simulation designed to replicate the appearance and movement of fish in an aquarium, providing a visually engaging and dynamic experience. The program uses the graphics.h library and is developed in Code::Blocks.

# **Features**

Sinusoidal Fish Movement: Four fish swim in sinusoidal paths to mimic realistic underwater motion.

Fish 1: Moves with a sine wave offset and features a body arc, tail, and eye.

Fish 2: Uses cosine wave offset for motion and is drawn with simple lines.

Fish 3: Moves right-to-left with a smooth sine wave pattern and an elliptical body.

Fish 4: Moves left-to-right, placed lower in the tank, and features a cosine offset.

Bubble Generation: Randomly generated bubbles rise to the surface, enhancing the simulation's realism.

Dynamic Visual Effects: Combined movement of fish and bubbles creates a lifelike oxygen tank effect.

Customizable Tank Design: The tank includes a bordered structure, stones, and grass for a visually appealing layout.

# **Requirements**

Code::Blocks IDE

graphics.h library 
# **How It Works**

**Fish Movement:**

Each fish follows a sinusoidal path, simulating natural swimming patterns.

Bubble Generation: Bubbles are generated at random positions and move upwards to simulate the release of oxygen in the tank.

Tank and Decorations:The aquarium includes a bordered structure, stones, and randomly growing grass at the bottom.

Main Animation Loop:The animation loop handles drawing the tank, animating fish, and generating bubbles in each frame. The delay function ensures smooth motion.
